1. String Tuples as Binary Strings - if an object of type $T$ can be represented as a string, then so can an n-tuple of objects of type $T$
	
	**a) mapping delimiter characters** - the strings forming a tuple need to be separated with a delimiter character which augments the alphabet set
	
	Example: 
	There exists an injection which maps pairs of binary strings $x, y \in \{0,1\}^*$ to a single string $z \in \{0,1,\parallel\}^*$ which represents a tuple. 
	
	Consider the strings $10$ and $01101$. They can be represented as a tuple by $10\parallel 01101$ where $\parallel$ is the chosen delimiter.
	
	Now this tuple needs to itself be represented as a binary string. This can be done by mapping $\{0, 1, \parallel\}$ to $\{00,11,01\} \subset \{0,1\}^*$. That way, a length $n$ string with three possible characters gets mapped to a string of length $2n$ with two possible characters. The example tuple $01\parallel 01101$ will then get mapped to $0011010011110011$.

2. Rational Numbers - any rational number is essentially a tuple $a/b$ with $/$ as the delimiter
	
	**a) as binary strings**
	- represent $a$ and $b$ as binary strings using signed magnitude representation 
	- represent the rational number as a tuple of binary strings
	- use the string-tuple-to-binary-string mapping to turn the tuple into a single string
	
	Example: Consider the number $-5/8$. We represent $-5$ as $1101$ and $+8$ as $01000$. These represent the tuple $1101/01000$ and we can map this to a binary string $11110011010011000000$.
