1. Representation Scheme - a one-to-one map between an object $x$ and a binary string $E(x) \in \{0,1\}^*$
	
	**a) injection** - the encoding function $E(x)$ must be injective in order to guarantee that two different objects $x$ and $x^{\prime}$ are mapped to different binary strings

2. Representation as a String - a representation scheme for any set $\mathcal{O}$ is a pair of functions $(E, D)$ where $E: \mathcal{O} \to \{0,1\}^*$ is a total one-to-one function, $D: \{0,1\}^* \to_{p} \mathcal{O}$ is a possibly partial function and such that $D(E(o)) = o, \forall o \in \mathcal{O}$.
	
	**a) encoding function** - $E$
	- every injective encoding function has a corresponding decoding function - let $E:\mathcal{O} \to \{0,1\}^*$ be one-to-one. Then there exists a function $D:\{0,1\}^* \to \mathcal{O}$ such that $D(E(o)) = o, \forall o \in \mathcal{O}$.
	
	Proof: 
	
	Let $o_0$ be an arbitrary element of $\mathcal{O}$. Since $E$ is one-to-one, then for every $x\in \{0,1\}^*$ there exist either zero or a single $o\in \mathcal{O}$ such that $E(o) = x$. The decoding function can then be defined for those two cases follows:
	
	$$D(x) = \begin{cases} o_0, \text{ when there is no } o\in \mathcal{O} \text{ such that } E(o) = x \\ o, \text{ when there is an } o\in \mathcal{O} \text{ such that } E(o) = x\end{cases}$$
	
	This satisfies the condition that $D$ is onto $\mathcal{O}$.
	
	**b) decoding function** - $D$
	- surjective - $D(E(o)) = o, \forall o\in \mathcal{O}$ means that $D$ must cover the entirety of $O$ because $E$ is a total one-to-one function
	- can technically be partial but is always total for any valid representation scheme due to the proof showing that every one-to-one encoding function has a decoding function
	
	**c) finite representations** - if $\mathcal{O}$ is finite, then every object in it can be represented by a string of length at most $n$, which is in the set $\{0,1\}^{\le n} \coloneqq \{x \in \{0,1\}^*: \vert x\vert \le n\}$
	- encoding function - this needs to be a one-to-one map from $\mathcal{O}$ to $\{0,1\}^{\le n}$, which is only possible if $\vert \mathcal{O} \vert \le \vert \{0,1\}^{\le n} \vert = 2^{n+1} - 1$ due to the pigeonhole principle

3. Prefix-free Encoding - a function $E: \mathcal{O} \to \{0,1\}^*$ which maps a non-empty set $\mathcal{O}$ to $\{0,1\}^*$ is prefix-free if $E(o) \ne \text{""}, \forall o \in \mathcal{O}$ and there is no pair of objects $o, o' \in \mathcal{O}$ such that $E(o)$ is a prefix of $E(o')$
	
	**a) tuple encoding** - if there is a prefix-free encoding $E: \mathcal{O} \to \{0,1\}^*$, then it is always possible to define a one-to-one encoding (that, however, is not itself prefix-free) which maps a finite tuple of objects in $\mathcal{O}$ to a string
	
	$$\bar{E}: \mathcal{O}^* \to \{0,1\}^*$$
	
	$$\bar{E}(o_0, o_1, ..., o_{k-1}) \coloneqq E(o_0)E(o_1)\cdots E(o_{k-1})$$
	
	Proof: 
	
	Suppose there are two distinct tuples $(o_0, o_1, ..., o_{k-1})$ and $(o_0', o_1', ..., o_{k'-1}')$ such that
	
	$$\bar{E} (o_0, o_1, ..., o_{k-1}) = \bar{E} (o_0', o_1', ..., o_{k'-1}')$$
	
	We said the tuples were distinct, so let $i$ denote the smallest index for which $o_i \ne o_i'$.
	
	If there is no such index, then one of the tuples must be larger (we assume without loss of generality that $k' \gt k$ in this case).
	
	Consider the case where $i \lt k$. Then the following is true:
	
	$$\bar{E}(o_0, o_1, ..., o_{k-1}) = E(o_0)\cdots E(o_{i-1})E(o_i)E(o_{i+1})\cdots E(o_{k-1})$$
	
	$$\bar{E}(o_0', o_1', ..., o_{k'-1}') = E(o_0)\cdots E(o_{i-1})E(o_i')E(o_{i+1}')\cdots E(o_{k'-1}')$$
	
	The two representations share a common prefix $x$ and so can be written as follows:
	
	$$\bar{E}(o_0, o_1, ..., o_{k-1}) = xE(o_i)E(o_{i+1})\cdots E(o_{k-1})$$
	
	$$\bar{E}(o_0', o_1', ..., o_{k'-1}') = xE(o_i')E(o_{i+1}')\cdots E(o_{k'-1}')$$
	
	Let $y$ denote the rest of the representation string after removing the prefix. Note that $y$ is identical for both representations since we assumed they were identical. The string $y$ can be written in the following two ways:
	
	$$\begin{cases}y = E(o_i)s, s \in \{0,1\}^* \\ y = E(o_i')s', s'\in \{0,1\}^*\end{cases} \implies E(o_i)s = E(o_i')s'$$
	
	This implies, however, that either $E(o_i)$ or $E(o_i)'$ has to be a prefix of the other, thus contradicting the prefix-freeness of $E$.
	
	In the case when $i = k$, we have that
	
	$$E(o_0)E(o_1)\cdots E(o_{k-1}) = E(o_0)E(o_1)\cdots E(o_{k-1})E(o_k')\cdots E(o_{k'-1}')$$
	
	This means that $E(o_k')\cdots E(o_{k'-1}')$ must be the empty string, thus contradicting once again the prefix-freeness of $E$.
	
	Both cases led to a contradiction, so the only possible conclusion is that there are no two distinct tuples for which
	
	$$\bar{E} (o_0, o_1, ..., o_{k-1}) = \bar{E} (o_0', o_1', ..., o_{k'-1}')$$
	
	**b) making representations prefix-free** - for every one-to-one encoding function $E: \mathcal{O} \to \{0,1\}^*$, there exists a corresponding prefix-free encoding $\bar{E}$ such that $|\bar{E}(o)| \le 2|E(o)| + 2$
	
	Proof:
	
	We define the following function:
	
	$$\text{PF}(x: \{0,1\}^*) \to \{0,1\}^* \coloneqq x_0x_0x_1x_1\cdots x_{n-1}x_{n-1}01$$
	
	Essentially, this function duplicates all of the characters of its input and then appends $01$ to signify the end of the string. For example, $\text{PF}(001011) = 00001100111101$. 
	
	Using this function, we also define $\bar{E}$:
	$$\bar{E}(x: \mathcal{O}) \to\, !\subseteq\{0,1\}^* \coloneqq \text{PF}(E(o))$$
	
	We need to prove that $\bar{E}$ is indeed injective and is also prefix-free, although proving the latter will suffice because if two strings are equal, then they are prefixes of each other. To do so, we need to prove that $\text{PF}$ is prefix-free.
	
	Consider two distinct objects $o \ne o'$ in $\mathcal{O}$. Let $x = E(o)$ and $x' = E(o')$. Since $E$ is one-to-one, $x \ne x'$.
	
	If $|x| \lt |x'|$, then the bits at positions $2|x|$ and $2|x| + 1$ in $\text{PF}(x)$ have values are $01$ and the bits at the same positions in $\text{PF}(x')$ will be either $00$ or $11$ (depending on the $|x|$-th bit of $x'$) which makes these strings equal and so one cannot be the prefix of the other.
	
	If $|x| = |x'|$, then since $x \ne x'$, there must be some position $i$ at which they differ and so $\text{PF}(x)$ and $\text{PF}(x')$ will differ at positions $2i$ and $2i+1$, once again meaning that one cannot be a prefix of the other.
	
	If $|x| \gt |x'|$, then $|\text{PF}(x)| = 2|x| + 2 \gt |\text{PF}(x')| = 2|x'|+2$ and so the former can't be a prefix of the latter because it is bigger, which completes the proof.
