1. Rational Number Approximation - any real number can be approximated by a rational number, so we already have established a way to represent real numbers to a certain accuracy

2. Floating-Point Representation - the base-two equivalent of scientific notation where a real number $x$ is represented by $\sigma b\times 2^e$ with $b$ and $e$ being integers

	- mantissa - the number $b$ with bit-length $k$ specifies a sequence of bits
	- exponent - the number $e$ with bit-length $l$ specifies the location of where to put the floating point in the bit sequence provides by $b$
	- sign - $\sigma \in \{\pm 1\}$ which gets mapped to a $1$ bit for a negative number and to $0$ for a positive number

3. Cantor's Theorem - there is no injection $\text{RtS}: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \{0,1\}^*$, meaning that it is impossible to exactly represent real numbers as strings
	
	Proof:
	
	To prove the theorem we will construct an infinite set $X$ for which it is easier to prove that there is no one-to-one map from it to $\{0,1\}^*$. Then, we will prove that there *is* a one-to-one map $G: X \to \mathbb{R}$.
	
	This is essentially a proof by contradiction. Suppose there is a function $F: \mathbb{R} \to \{0,1\}^*$. Then, the composite function $F(G(x))$ would be a one-to-one map from $X$ to $\{0,1\}^*$ which is a contradiction because we will prove that there is no such map.
	
	Now, let $\{0,1\}^{\infty}$ represent the set of all functions which take a natural number as an input and produce either a $0$ or a $1$. That is,
	
	$$\{0,1\}^{\infty} \coloneqq \{f \vert f: \mathbb{N}_0 \to \{0,1\}\}$$
	
	Now we prove a lemma stating that there is no injection "Functions to Strings" ( $\text{FtS}: \{0,1\}^{\infty} \to \{0,1\}^*$ ) which is equivalent to showing that there is no surjection "Strings to Functions" ( $\text{StF}: \{0,1\}^* \to \{0,1\}^{\infty}$ ).


	Assume there is such a function $\text{StF}:\{0,1\}^* \to \{0,1\}^{\infty}$. Consider the lexicographic ordering of binary strings $(\text{""}, 0, 1, 00, 11,...)$ and let $x_n (n \in \mathbb{N}_0)$ denote the $n$-th member of this tuple. We define  the following function $\bar{d} \in \{0,1\}^{\infty}$:
	
	$$\bar{d}(n) = 1 - \text{StF}(x_n)(n)$$
	This is a lot to unpack. Essentially 
	$\text{StF}(x_n)$ returns a function corresponding to the string $x_n$, which we will call $g_{x_n} \in \{0,1\}^{\infty}$, and then this returned function is called with $n$. The above definition can be rewritten as:
	
	$$\bar{d}(n) = 1 - g_{x_n}(n), g_{x_n}(n) = \text{StF}(x_n)$$
	
	Since $g(n)$ returns either a 0 or a 1, $\bar{d}(n)$ can be thought of as the negation of $g_{x_n}(n)$. All this can be represented in table form:
	
	![StF Table Form](Resources/StF%20Table%20Form.jpg)
	
	This table is essentially a definition of $\text{StF}$. Each row corresponds to a function $g_i = \text{StF}(i), i \in \{x_0,x_1,x_2,...\}$ and each column corresponds to a number $n\in \mathbb{N}_0$ which is passed to the functions $g_i$. Each cell is then equal to $g_i(n) = \text{StF}(x_n)(n)$.
	
	By definition, $\bar{d}(n) = 1 - \text{StF}(x_n)(n)$, which means that $\bar{d}$ operates on the diagonal values of the table. Additionally, since $\bar{d}(n)$ is the negation of $g_{x_n}(n)$, then $\bar{d}(n)$ must differ from every possible function $g_{x_n}$ for at least one input. But this means that we have just managed to construct a function which is not in the table and therefore is not covered by $\text{StF}$. Therefore, there is no function $\text{StF}$ which is onto $\{0,1\}^{\infty}$ because $\bar{d}: \mathbb{N}_0 \to \{0, 1\} \in \{0,1\}^{\infty}$ but we just showed that $\bar{d}$ is not in the image of $\text{StF}$. This means that we have shown that there is no one-to-one map $\text{FtS}: \{0,1\}^{\infty} \to \{0,1\}^*$.
	
	Now we prove that there *is* a one-to-one map $\text{FtR}: \{0,1\}^{\infty} \to \mathbb{R}$. TODO
