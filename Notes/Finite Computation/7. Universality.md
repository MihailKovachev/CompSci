1. NAND Universality - for every function $f: \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}^m$, there exists a NAND-CIRC programme with at most $c\cdot m2^n$ lines (where $c \gt 0$ is some constant) which computes $f$
	
	Proof:
	
	We define the function $LOOKUPSTR_m: \{0,1\}^{m2^n + n} \to \{0,1\}^m$ as follows:
	$$LOOKUPSTR_m(x,i) \coloneqq x_{(i\cdot m)}x_{(i\cdot m + 1)},...,x_{(i\cdot m + m - 1)}$$
	
	This function can be imagined as taking a tuple of $n$ strings of length $m$ and then returing the $i$-th string in the tuple.
	
	Now, every function $f: \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}^m$ can be written as a table listing all the inputs of $f$ and their corresponding output. Let the set of all possible inputs for the function be $\{x_0,x_1,...\}$ where $x_i$ is a binary string of length $n$. The set of the corresponding outputs is then $\{f(x_0), f(x_1),...\}$ where $f(x_i)$ is a binary string of length $m$. We construct a new string called $F$ which is the concatenation of all the outputs of $f$ as
	
	$$F = f(x_0)f(x_1)...$$
	
	This string has length $m2^n$ - you have $2^n$ (the size of the input set, $\{0,1\}^n$) strings of length $m$ concatenated together. Then, the for every $x\in \{0,1\}^n$, $f(x) = LOOKUPSTR_n(F, x)$.
	
	All we need to do now, is to show that $LOOKUPSTR_n$ can be computed by a NAND-CIRC programme. This is possible because $LOOKUPSTR_m$ can be broken down into the concatenation of regular $LOOKUP_k$ functions, which we have already shown to be computable by NAND.
	
	$$LOOKUPSTR_m(x,i) = LOOKUP_k(x, i\cdot m)LOOKUP_k(x, i \cdot m + 1)\cdots LOOKUP_k(x, i \cdot m + m - 1)$$
