1. Syntactic Sugar - features which build on top of a programming language's already existing features and do NOT change its functionality, but merely make writing it more efficient

2. Procedures - these are blocks of lines of a programming language which act on a set of arguments, perform a certain computation on them and then return the result as a value that can be stored in a variable
	
	**a) NAND-CIRC-PROC** - a version of the NAND-CIRC language augmented with the following syntax for defining and calling procedures such that for every NAND-CIRC-PROC programme $P$, there exists a "sugar-free" NAND-CIRC programme $P'$ which computes the same function as $P$ without using procedures

	```python
	# procedure definition
	def proc_name(param_1, param_2, ...):
	proc_code
	return proc_return_val
	# procedure invocations
	temp = proc_name(arg_1, arg_2,...)
	```
	- implementation - this can be implemented via a search-and-replace operation where every occurrence of a line of the form `foo = proc_name(arg_1,arg_2,...)` is replaced by the procedures' code and the variables inside it are substituted for `arg_1`, `arg_2`, ...; the `return` statement is replaced by `foo = return_val`; if the procedure defines temporary variables, then their names can be prefixed for example by the procedure's name and the line number of the current invocation to ensure their uniqueness 
	
	Note: 
	
	This bare-bones implementation is more akin to the modern notion of *macros*, but it gets across the point just fine. Nowadays, procedure code is typically stored separately and then the programme jumps and returns back from it. If anything, this definition here is the definition of an *inline function*. 
	
	Additionally, the "search-and-replace" approach prohibits recursive procedures, i.e. procedures that call themselves, because the search and replace may never end.
	- number of lines - note that while such programmes can seemingly be written in less lines, in reality, the number of lines $s$ remains unchanged from their NAND-CIRC counterparts because at the end, the NAND-CIRC-PROC programme is expanded out into a regular NAND-CIRC one

3. Conditional Statements - if/then/else constructs allow for the conditional execution of code depending whether a value is zero or one; this can be done via the computation of the $IF: \{0,1\}^3 \to \{0,1\}$ function defined as
	
	$$IF(cond,a,b) \coloneqq \begin{cases}a, cond = 1 \\ b, cond = 0\end{cases}$$
	
	**a) NAND-CIRC-IF** - a version of NAND-CIRC-PROC for which we define the following `IF` procedure to compute the $IF$ function:

	```python
	def IF(cond, a, b)
		notcond = NAND(cond, cond)
		temp = NAND(b, notcond)
		temp2 = NAND(a, cond)
		return NAND(temp, temp2)
	```
	
	Using this pre-defined procedure, pseudocode of the form
	
	```python
	if condition:
		a = ...
		b = ...
		c = ...
	```
	can be converted to NAND-CIRC-IF code of the form
	
	```python
	temp_a = ...
	temp_b = ...
	temp_c = ...
	a = IF(condition, temp_a, a)
	b = IF(condition, temp_b, b)
	c = IF(condition, temp_c, c)
	```
	- NAND-CIRC compatibility - every NAND-CIRC-IF programme $P$ can be expanded out into a NAND-CIRC programme by expanding all procedures inside it, including all the `IF`s
