1. Equivalence of Boolean Circuits and AON-CIRC programmes - the function $f:\{0,1\}^n \to\{0,1\}^m$ is computable by a boolean circuit with $s \ge m$ gates iff it is computable by an AON-CIRC programme of $s$ lines
	
	Proof:
	
	Let $P$ be an AON-CIRC programme which computes $f$. We define a boolean circuit $C$ with $n$ inputs and $s$ gates such that for $i = \{0,1,
	..,s-1\}$, the $i$-th gate is one of the following:
	- if the $i$-th line is of the form `foo = NOT(bar)` - a NOT gate connected to gate $j$ which corresponds to the $j$-th line in the AON-CIRC programme; this is the last line where `bar` was last written to before the $i$-th line
	- if the $i$-th line is of the form `foo = AND(bar, baz)` or `foo = OR(bar, baz)` - an AND/OR gate connected to gates $j$ and $k$ where the $j$-th and $k$ lines in the AON-CIRC programmes are the last lines where `bar` and `baz` were written to before the $i$-th line
	- if the variables `bar` and/or `baz` are input variables, then the $i$-th gate is connected to the corresponding input vertex instead
	- if `foo` is an output variable, then it is additionally stamped with the corresponding label
	
	In this way, when executing $P$ on $x\in\{0,1\}^n$, the value computed in the $i$-th line will be assigned to the $i$-th gate if $C$ is evaluated on the same input. Therefore, $C(x) = P(x)$ for every valid input and so $C$ is also a circuit which computes $f$. 
	
	For the other direction, let $C$ be a boolean circuit with $n$ inputs and $s$ gates which computes $f: \{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}^m$. We sort the circuit according to a minimal layering and write the nodes as $v_0, v_1,..., v_{s+n-1}$. Now, for every $i \in \{n,n+1,...,n+s-2,n+s-1\}$ we do one of the following:
	- if $v_i$ is a NOT gate with in-neightbour $v_j$, we add a line `temp_i = NOT(temp_j)` to our programme $P$
	- if $v_i$ is an AND/OR gate with in-neighbours $v_j$ and $v_k$, we add to our programme $P$ either `temp_i = AND(temp_j, temp_k)` or `temp_i = OR(temp_j, temp_k)`, respectively
	- if $v_i$ is an output gate, we replace `temp_i` with the output gate label of the form `X[x]`
	- if an in-neighbour is an input gate, then we replace its `temp_x` label with the input gate label of the form `Y[x]`
	
	Minimal layering guarantees that the in-neighbours correspond to variables which have already been assigned a value. Executing the programme $P$ on an input $x \in \{0,1\}^n$ will compute the same result as executing the circuit $C$ on the same input because the $i$-th line of the programme will compute the same value that will be assigned to the $i$-th gate. Therefore, $P$ also computes $f$.

2. Equivalence of NAND circuits and NAND-CIRC programmes - for every $f: \{0,1\}^n\to \{0,1\}^m$ and $s\ge m$, the function $f$ is computable by a NAND-CIRC programme with $s$ lines iff it is computable by a NAND circuit with $s$ gates
	
	Proof:
	
	The proof is similar to the proof for the equivalence of AON-CIRC programmes and boolean circuits - every line of the programme can be replaced by a NAND gate and vice versa.

3. General Equivalence - for every sufficiently large $s,n,m$ and $f:\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}^m$, the following conditions are equivalent to one another
	- $f$ can be computed by a Boolean circuit of at most $O(s)$ gates
	- $f$ can be computed by an AON-CIRC programme of at most $O(s)$ lines
	- $f$ can be computed by a NAND circuit of at most $O(s)$ gates
	- $f$ can be computed by a NAND-CIRC programme of at most $O(s)$ lines
	
	The notation $O(s)$ denotes the bound $c\times s$ for some constant $c$, independent of $n$. The proof is obtained by combining the previous two proofs.
