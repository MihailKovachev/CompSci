1. Lookup Function - for every $k$, the *lookup* function $LOOKUP_k: \{0,1\}^{2^k + k} \to \{0,1\}$ is defined for every $x\in\{0,1\}^{2^k}$ and $i\in\{0,1\}^k$ as follows:
	
	$$LOOKUP_k(x,i) = x_i$$

	**a) intuition** - the lookup function returns the $i$-th bit of the binary string $x$ of length $2^k$
	- $i$ is the binary representation of a number that can be matched to a number  $\{0,1,...,2^k-1\}$

2. NAND-Computability - for every $k\gt 0$, there is a NAND-CIRC programme that computes the $LOOKUP_k$ function with at most $4 \cdot (2^k - 1)$ lines
	
	Proof:
	
	First, we prove that for every $k \ge 2$
	
	$$LOOKUP_k(x_0,...,x_{2^k-1}, i_0,...,i_{k-1}) = IF(i_0, LOOKUP_{k-1}(x_{2^{k-1}},..., x_{2^k-1},i_1,...,i_{k-1}), LOOKUP_{k-1}(x_0,...,x_{2^{k-1}-1},i_1,...,i_{k-1}))$$
	
	If the most significant bit $i_0$ of $i$ is 0, then the bit we want from $x$ will be in the first half of $x$ ($i \in \{0,...,2^{k-1}-1\}$) and so to get the result of $LOOKUP_k$ will only need to search the first half of $x$: $LOOKUP_{k-1}(x_0,...,x_{2^{k-1}},i_1,...,i_{k-1})$. On the other hand, if $i_0$ is 1, then the index is in $\{2^{k-1},...,2^k-1\}$ and so the result of $LOOKUP_{k}$ will be in the second half of $x$: $LOOKUP_{k-1}(x_{2^{k-1}},...,x_{2^k-1},i_1,...,i_{k-1})$.
	
	Now, we are ready to prove the general theorem. Let $L(k)$ denote the number of lines required for $LOOKUP_k$.
	
	Induction Hypothesis: $L(k) \le 4\cdot (2^k -1)$
	
	Base Case:
	
	For the case of $k = 1$, the lookup function $LOOKUP_1(x_0,x_1,i)$ will output $x_0$ if $i=0$ and will output $x_1$ if $i=1$. This is a simple $IF$ function which can be computed by the following NAND-CIRC lines:
	
	```
	def LOOKUP(x0, x1, i):
		temp1 = NAND(i, i)
		temp2 = NAND(x0, temp1)
		temp3 = NAND(x1, i)
		return NAND(temp2, temp3)
	```
	
	This code is 4 lines (the declaration isn't counted, its there simply for clarity, and the return statement corresponds to a line of the form `foo = NAND(temp2,temp3`) - which is indeed less than $4\cdot 2^1$, so the induction hypothesis holds for the base case.
	
	Inductive Step:
	
	For $k \gt 1$, we have already shown that we can compute $LOOKUP_k$ by separating it into 2 invocations of $LOOKUP_{k-1}$ and one invocation of $IF$ as follows:
	
	```python
	def LOOKUP[k](x[0],x[1],...,x[2^k-1],i[0],...,i[k-1]):
		a = LOOKUP[k-1](x[0],...,x[2^(k-1)-1],i[1],...,i[k-1])
		b = LOOKUP[k-1](x[2^(k-1)],...,x[2^(k-1)],i[1],...,i[k-1])
		return IF(i[0],b,a)
	```
	
	This shows that $L(k) \le 2L(k-1) +4$ (the if procedures expands to four lines). By our induction hypothesis, $L(k-1) \le 4(2^{k-1}-1)$, and so our expression expands to
	
	$$L(k) \le 2(4(2^{k-1}-1))+4$$
	
	$$L(k) \le 4(2^k -1)$$
	
	And this completes the proof.
