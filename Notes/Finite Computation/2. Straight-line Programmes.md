1. AON-CIRC ("AND/OR/NOT circuit") programme - a sequence of strings called "lines" written in the AON-CIRC programming language which satisfy the following conditions
	
	**a) variable identifier** - an arbitrary combination of letters, numbers, underscores and brackets which identifies a variable
	- input variables (in total $n$) - variables of the form `X[i]`, $i \in \{0,1,...,n-1\}$
	- output variables (in total $m$) - variables of the form `Y[j]`, $j \in \{0,1,...,m-1\}$
	
	**b) syntax** - every line has one of the following forms which contain the variable identifiers in the places of `foo`, `bar` and `baz`; the variables on the right-hand side must either be inpur variables or variable which have already been assigned a value in a previous row
	- `foo = AND(bar, baz)` - `foo` is assigned the result of the logical AND operation on `bar` and `baz`
	- `foo = OR(bar, baz)` - `foo` is assigned the result of the logical OR operation on `bar` and `baz`
	- `foo = NOT(bar)` - `foo` is assigned the result of the logical NOT operation on `bar`
	
	**c) output** - the output of an AON-CIRC programme $P$ on an input $x\in\{0,1\}^n$, denoted by $P(x)$, is the string $y \in \{0,1\}^m$ defined as follows
	- initialise the input variables $\text{X}[0], ..., \text{X}[n-1]$ to the values $x_0,...,x_{n-1}$
	- execute the lines of $P$ one by one, in each line assigning to the variable on the left-hand side the value of the operation on the right-hand side
	- let $y\in\{0,1\}^m$ be the values of the output variables $\text{Y}[0],...,\text{Y}[n-1]$ at the end of execution
	
	**d) size** - the number of lines the programme has

2. Function Computation via an AON-CIRC programme - the AON-CIRC programme $P$ with $n$ inputs and $m$ outputs computes the function $f: \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}^m$ if $P(x) = f(x), \forall x\in\{0,1\}^n$
	
	Example: 
	
	Consider the function $CMP: \{0,1\}^4 \to \{0,1\}$ which acts on four inputs $a,b,c,d \in \{0,1\}$ and outputs 1 iff the number represented by $(a,b)$ is larger than the number represented by $(c, d)$. That is, $CMP(a,b,c,d) = 1$ iff $2a + b \gt 2c + d$.
	
	To turn this into an AON-CIRC programme, we need to think about what it means for two binary numbers to be larger. Essentially, the number represented by $(a,b)$ is larger than $(c,d)$ iff its most significant bit $a$ is larger than $c$ or if they are equal, but $b$ is larger than $d$. This can be summarised as $(a \gt c) \text{ OR } (a = c \text{ AND } b \gt d)$.
	
	For binary digits $\alpha$ and $\beta$, the condition that $\alpha \gt \beta$ means simply that $\alpha$ needs to be 1 and $\beta$ needs to be 0. This can be expressed as $\alpha \land \neg\beta$. The condition $\alpha = \beta$ can be expressed as $(\alpha \land \beta) \lor (\neg\alpha \land \neg\beta)$. 
	
	Our desired condition for a two-bit number to be greater than another can then be expressed as
	
	$$(a \land \neg c) \lor (((a \land c) \lor (\neg a \land \neg c)) \land (b \land \neg d))$$
	
	This can be further simplified, but it won't be so obvious what it is supposed to represent if this is done. So, this expression can now be turned into the following AON-
	CIRC programme:

```python
temp_1 = NOT(Y[2]) # NOT(c)
temp_2 = NOT(Y(0)) # NOT(a)
temp_3 = NOT(Y[3]) # NOT(d)
a_greater_than_c = AND(Y[0], temp_1)
temp_4 = AND(Y[0],Y[2]) # are both a and c 1
temp_5 = AND(temp_2, temp_1) # are both a and c 0
a_and_c_equal = OR(temp_4, temp_5)
b_greater_than_d = AND(Y[1], temp_3)
temp_6 = AND(are_a_and_c_equal, b_greater_than_d)
Y[0] = OR(a_greater_than_c, temp_6)
```

3. NAND-CIRC Programme - a sequence of strings called "lines" which satisfy the following conditions
	
	**a) variable identifier** - an arbitrary combination of letters, numbers, underscores and brackets which identifies a variable
	- input variables (in total $n$) - variables of the form `X[i]`, $i \in \{0,1,...,n-1\}$
	- output variables (in total $m$) - variables of the form `Y[j]`, $j \in \{0,1,...,m-1\}$
	
	**b) syntax** - every line has the following form where `foo`, `bar` and `baz` are variable identifiers
	
	```python
	foo = NAND(bar, baz)
	```

	**c) output** - the output of a NAND-CIRC programme $P$ on an input $x\in\{0,1\}^n$, denoted by $P(x)$, is the string $y \in \{0,1\}^m$ defined as follows
	- initialise the input variables $\text{X}[0], ..., \text{X}[n-1]$ to the values $x_0,...,x_{n-1}$
	- execute the lines of $P$ one by one, in each line assigning to the variable on the left-hand side the value of the operation on the right-hand side
	- let $y\in\{0,1\}^m$ be the values of the output variables $\text{Y}[0],...,\text{Y}[n-1]$ at the end of execution
	
	**d) size** - the number of lines the programme has

4. Function Computation via a NAND-CIRC programme - the NAND-CIRC programme $P$ with $n$ inputs and $m$ outputs computes the function $f: \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}^m$ if $P(x) = f(x), \forall x\in\{0,1\}^n$

5. General Straight-line Programmes - for any finite set of boolean functions $\mathcal{F} = \{f_0, f_1,...,f_{t-1}\}$ where $f_i: \{0,1\}^{k_i} \to \{0,1\}, i, k_i \in \mathbb{N}_0$, an $\mathcal{F}$ *programme* is a sequence of lines, each of which assigns to some variable the result of applying some $f_i \in \mathcal{F}$ to $k_i$ other variables.
	
	**a) universal set of operations** - the set $\mathcal{F}$ is a universal set of operations if there exists an $\mathcal{F}$ programme which computes the NAND gate
	- if the NAND gate can be computed, then so can AND, OR and NOT
	
	**b) inputs** - the variables $\text{X}[i]$
	
	**c) outputs** - the variables $\text{Y}[i]$
