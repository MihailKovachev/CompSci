1. Boolean Circuit - a boolean circuit with $n$ inputs, $m$ outputs and $s$ gates is a labeled directed acyclic graph $G = (V, E)$ with $s+n$ nodes
	
	**a) inputs** - the $n$ nodes without any in-neighbours; these have at least one out-neighbour and are labeled with the $n$ labels $\text{X}[0], \text{X}[1],...,\text{X}[n-1]$
	
	**b) gates** - the other $s$ nodes
	- $\land\, (AND)$ - two in-neighbours
	- $\lor\,(OR)$ - two in-neighbours 
	- $\neg\,(NOT)$ - one in-neighbour
	
	**c) outputs** - exactly $m$ of the gates are additionally labeled with the labels $\text{Y}[0],...,\text{Y}[m-1]$
	
	**d) size** - the number of gates $s$

2. Function Computation via a Boolean Circuit - let $C$ be a boolean circuit with $n$ inputs and $m$ outputs; the output of $C$ on an input $x\in\{0,1\}^n$, denoted as $C(x)$ is calculated using the following process:
	
	For every layer $l = 0,1,2,..., L$ in the minimal layering $h: V \to \mathbb{N}$ of $C$ do the following:
	- if $v$ is an input vertex labeled $\text{X}[i]$, then assign to $v$ the value $x_i$
	- if $v$ is an AND gate with two in-neighbours $u$ and $w$, assign to it the value $AND(u, w)$ - the in-neighbours $u$ and $w$ would have already been assigned values because they are in a lower layer than $v$
	- if $v$ is an OR gate with two in-neighbours $u$ and $w$, assign to it the value $OR(u,w)$ - the in-neighbours $u$ and $w$ would have already been assigned values because they are in a lower layer than $v$
	- if $v$ is a NOT gate with a single in-neighbour $u$, assign to it the value $NOT(u)$ - the in-neighbour $u$ would have already been assigned a value because it is in a lower layer than $v$
	
	The result of this process is the value $y \in \{0,1\}^m$ such that for every $y_j$ is the value assigned to the gate labeled $\text{Y}[j]$ for every $j \in \{0,1,...,m-1\}$.
	
	**a) computing a function ** - if $f: \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}^m$, then the circuit $C$ is said to compute $f$ if $C(x) = f(x), \forall x \in \{0,1\}^n$
