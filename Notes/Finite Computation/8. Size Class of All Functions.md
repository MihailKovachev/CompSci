1. $SIZE_{n,m}(s)$ - the set of all functions of the form $f: \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}^m$ for some $n$ and $m$ which can be represented by a NAND programme of at most $s$ lines

2. $SIZE(s) = \bigcup_{n,m} SIZE_{n,m}(s)$ - the set of all functions which can be computed by a NAND-CIRC programme of at most $s$ lines

3. $SIZE_{n,m}^{AON}(s)$ - the set of all functions of the form $f: \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}^m$ for some $n$ and $m$ which can be computed by an AON-CIRC programme of at most $s$ lines
	
	**a) properties**
	- relation to functions that can be computed by NAND-CIRC programmes
	
	$$SIZE_{n,m}(s/2) \subseteq SIZE_{n,m}^{AON}(s) \subseteq SIZE_{n,m}(3s)$$
	
	Proof:
	
	If $f$ can be computed by a NAND-CIRC programme of at most $s/2$ lines, then by replacing every NAND with NOT and AND, we can obtain an AON-CIRC programme which computes $f$ in at most $s$ lines. On the other hand, if $f$ is computable by an AON-CIRC programme of at most $s$ lines, then by substituting AND/OR/NOT line with its corresponding NAND representation, then $f$ can be computed by a NAND-CIRC programme of at most $3s$ lines. This maximum is achieved when the AON-CIRC programme uses only AND and OR.
