1. Single-pass constant-memory algorithms - algorithms which take a single pass over their input and have a finite working memory (variables used during its execution)
	
	**a) state** - the values of the working memory at a given step during the algorithm's execution

2. Deterministic Finite Automaton - a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) with $C$ states over $\{0,1\}$ is a pair $(T,\mathcal{S})$ with a *transition function* $T: \{0,1,...,C-1\}\times \{0,1\} \to \{0,1,...,C-1\}$ and a *set of accepting states* $\mathcal{S}\subseteq \{0,1,...,C-1\}$
	
	**a) intuition** - the DFA begins in some initial state and then reads its input $x\in\{0,1\}^*$ bit by bit; whenever it reads a bit $\sigma$, it updates its internal state based on $\sigma$ and its current state
	- this process can be described by a table of $2C$ rules (there are $C$ possible states and two possible values for the bit $\sigma$) which maps the current state and $\sigma$ to an output state - this is precisely the transition function $T: \{0,1,...,C-1\}\times \{0,1\} \to \{0,1,...,C-1\}$ which takes in a state and an input bit and outputs a new state
	- the *accepting states* $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of all sets for which the automaton will output a 1 at the end of computation
	
	**b) function  omputation** - a DFA $(T,\mathcal{S})$ computes a boolean function $F: \{0,1\}^* \to \{0,1\}$ if for every input $x\in\{0,1\}^n$ and for every $n\in\mathbb{N}$, if we define the initial state $s_0 = 0$ and the subsequent states as $s_{i+1} = T(s_i, x_i), i \in \{0,1,...n-1\}$, then the final state $s_n$ is in the accepting states $\mathcal{S}$ iff $F(x)=1$
