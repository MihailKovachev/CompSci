1. Boolean Function - an infinite function $F: \{0,1\}^* \to \{0,1\}$ which produces a single bit as its output
	
	**a) formal language** - the set $L_F = \{x|F(x) = 1\}$ of all inputs for which the boolean function $F$ returns a 1
	- deciding a language - this phrasing is equivalent to "computing a boolean function"

2. Function Restriction - the restriction of an infinite boolean function $F$ to inputs of length $n \in \mathbb{N}$, denoted by $F_n$, is a finite function $f: \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ such that $f(x) = F(x)$ for every $x \in \{0,1\}^n$
